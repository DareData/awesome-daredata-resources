## Books
| Name | By | Description | Category | Added by | Comments | 
| :--- | :- | :---------- | :--- | :--------- | :---- |
| [The Power of Habit](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X) | Charles Duhigg | In The Power of Habit, business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed.  | Management&Business | Ivo | Great to understand how to build more powerful habits. If you are having trouble setting routines of work, you should give it a try! |
| [How Big Things Get Done](https://www.amazon.com/How-Big-Things-Get-Done/dp/0593239512) | Bent Flyvbjerg | Nothing is more inspiring than a big vision that becomes a triumphant, new reality. Think of how the Empire State Building went from a sketch to the jewel of New York’s skyline in twenty-one months, or how Apple’s iPod went from a project with a single employee to a product launch in eleven months. | Management&Business | Ivo | Interesting to understand why big projects work or fail |
| [Designing Machine Learning Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Machine-Learning-Systems-Production-Ready/dp/1098107969) | Chip Huyen | Machine learning systems are both complex and unique. Complex because they consist of many different components and involve many different stakeholders. Unique because they're data dependent, with data varying wildly from one use case to the next. In this book, you'll learn a holistic approach to designing ML systems that are reliable, scalable, maintainable, and adaptive to changing environments and business requirements. | Machine Learning | Ivo | Great introductory book to MLOps and the need to use MLOps systems |
| [Personal MBA](https://www.amazon.com/Personal-MBA-Master-Art-Business/dp/1591845572) | Josh Kaufman | Josh Kaufman founded PersonalMBA.com as an alternative to the business school boondoggle. His blog has introduced hundreds of thousands of readers to the best business books and most powerful business concepts of all time. Now, he shares the essentials of entrepreneurship, marketing, sales, negotiation, operations, productivity, systems design, and much more, in one comprehensive volume. The Personal MBA distills the most valuable business lessons into simple, memorable mental models that can be applied to real-world challenges.  | Management | Ivo | Cool book for an introduction on management topics. |
| [Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898) | Eric Ries | The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on “validated learning,” rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. | Management | Sofia | An approach to create innovative businesses/products that are really needed |
| [The Psychology of Money](https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Money-Timeless-lessons-happiness/dp/0857197681) | Morgan Housel | Money―investing, personal finance, and business decisions―is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world people don’t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. | Finance | João Miranda | A different, more down to earth, view on personal finances and investing |
| [Influence: Psychology of Persuation](https://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Robert-Cialdini/dp/006124189X) | Robert Cialdini | Influence is typically taught as a matter of logic and reason—people weigh facts and make rational choices. But in real life, decisions are shaped by invisible psychological forces: the urge to reciprocate, the desire to fit in, our need for consistency, and how we perceive authority or scarcity. We say “yes” not because we’ve done the math, but because we’re human—wired to respond to subtle cues long before we even realize it. | Psychology/Business | Ivo Bernardo| A summary of things that move us when it comes to decision making |
| [Think Again](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Again-Power-Knowing-What/dp/1984878107) | Adam Grant | Think Again challenges the idea that intelligence is about always being right. Instead, it shows that real strength comes from rethinking, unlearning, and updating our beliefs. Grant explores how many high performers suffer from impostor syndrome—not because they lack ability, but because they constantly question their own legitimacy. The book reframes self-doubt as a sign of growth, teaching readers to treat uncertainty as a learning tool rather than a weakness. | Psychology/Business | Ivo Bernardo | A guide to rethinking beliefs, managing self-doubt, and using impostor syndrome as a driver for learning |
